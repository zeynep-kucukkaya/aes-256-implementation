# AES-256 Encryption Application

This project is a Python-based implementation of the AES-256 encryption algorithm, developed to understand the fundamentals of symmetric cryptography and secure data transmission.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with cryptographic concepts such as key generation, encryption, and decryption while working with a widely used industry-standard algorithm.

## Features
- 256-bit key generation
- AES-based encryption process
- Secure decryption using the same symmetric key

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Cryptography fundamentals

## Motivation
This project was created as part of my self-directed learning process to better understand encryption logic and secure data handling mechanisms.

## Project Status
- Ongoing (open to improvements and optimizations)
